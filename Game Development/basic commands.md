# **_Game Development Basics_**

## **_Create a Object to start_**

> **_puck.create(x, y, "shape"); => Command to create Object to start._**
>
> > `x => Count on X-axis.`  
> > `y => Count on Y-axis.`  
> > `shape => Shape of our Object.`  
> > `It can be either Circle, Square, Triangle, and Hexagon.`

## **_Create a Goal point to win the game_**

> **_goal.create(x, y); => Command to create Goal._**
>
> > `x => Count on X-axis.`  
> > `y => Count on Y-axis.`

## **_Create a Obstacle to make some difficulty in game._**

> **_obstacle.create(x, y, "shape"); => Command to create Obstacle._**
>
> > `x => Count on X-axis.`  
> > `y => Count on Y-axis.`  
> > `shape => Shape of our Obstacle.`  
> > `It can be either Circle, Square, Triangle, and Hexagon.`

## **_Making Game more Faster, Slower, and Change shape of the Object by using obstacle command._**

> **_obstacle.create(x, y, "shape", "type");_**
>
> > `Same as obstacle Conditions.`  
> > `type can be`
> >
> > > `Faster which make Object to move fast.`  
> > > `Slower which make Object to move slow.`  
> > > `Change which changes the shape of the Object into that collided Odstacle.`
